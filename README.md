Just execute `go run main.go` to see it write the trial numbers, distinct values, and the running mean for 10,000 trials for random integers between 0 and 501 to the output.csv file. The trial number and running mean can be graphed to visualise the stabalisation of the running mean on the theoritcal mean.
